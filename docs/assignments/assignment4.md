## Reflection
During the writing of my backend code, I realized that I had some concepts that were extremely similar, and some that were not necessarily as easily implementable as I had thought. For example, I had thought of using messaging as one of my concepts. However, due to already having many different ideas I wanted to implement in the front end that might be difficult (i.e, making the scheduling part, the goals page, etc), I thought since this seemed to be another pretty challenging concept it may not be worth doing both and instead doing one of them really well. Secondly, I realized that my encouragements (basically comments on a goal that was posted), were exactly the same concept as commenting. So, I decided to only keep commenting and use this concept for either normal posts and goals, and these two can be handled differently and be displayed differently within the front end. 
Overall, actually creating these concepts really solidified my ideas for my app in general, and the main features that I want it to have, which are the normal posting and commenting features, the goal setting and commenting on those, and mostly the scheduling aspect of it also. I think during the design of the backend I realized that a lot of the things I would like to implement, like the blocking of content during focus mode, will have to be implemented in the front end by using the scheduling concept that I wrote, so that may take a lot of work.
