# Blog Post Response 1

I really liked how you explored how companies like ZipCar/ Uber align business goals and social impact goals, I think it provides valuable advice/outlook for people like student in this class, myself included that are software developers aiming to build meaningful applications.

I actually completely agree with your assessment of how companies like Uber can be a positive and very efficient, cost effective, and even more environment friendly solution for people who need to get around. But I also just wanted to point out, like we discussed in class when talking about unexpected problems with scaling of apps, that Uber has also had similar downsides after gaining global popularity. In my home city, and even here in Boston/Cambridge, many taxi companies are going out of service and many people lost their jobs or faced bankruptcy because of how cheap, fast, convenient and easy to use apps like Uber and Lyft are.

Again, I completely agree with your blog post and thought your comments about these two examples were spot on and well described but I think it’s interesting how at a scale as large the one of as Uber or Lyft, it sometimes feels like it is almost impossible to create an app that is not detrimental to a group of people. I haven’t noticed anything similar with Zipcar, but maybe there is a comparison.

Loved your blog post!
